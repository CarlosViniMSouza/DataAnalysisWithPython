## Working with numerical data

The "data" in *Data Analysis* typically refers to numerical data, e.g., stock prices, sales figures, sensor measurements, sports scores, database tables, etc. The [Numpy](https://numpy.org) library provides specialized data structures, functions, and other tools for numerical computing in Python. Let's work through an example to see why & how to use Numpy for working with numerical data.


> Suppose we want to use climate data like the temperature, rainfall, and humidity to determine if a region is well suited for growing apples. A simple approach for doing this would be to formulate the relationship between the annual yield of apples (tons per hectare) and the climatic conditions like the average temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit), rainfall (in  millimeters) & average relative humidity (in percentage) as a linear equation.
>
> `yield_of_apples = w1 * temperature + w2 * rainfall + w3 * humidity`

Based on some statical analysis of historical data, we might come up with reasonable values for the weights `w1`, `w2`, and `w3`. Here's an example set of values:

```python
w1, w2, w3 = 0.3, 0.2, 0.5
```

Given some climate data for a region, we can now predict the yield of apples. Here's some sample data:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TXPBiqv.png" style="width:360px;"></img>

To begin, we can define some variables to record climate data for a region.

```python
kanto_temp = 73
kanto_rainfall = 67
kanto_humidity = 43
```

We can now substitute these variables into the linear equation to predict the yield of apples.

```python
kanto_yield_apples = kanto_temp * w1 + kanto_rainfall * w2 + kanto_humidity * w3
kanto_yield_apples
```

```python
# To make it slightly easier to perform the above computation for multiple regions, 
# we can represent the climate data for each region as a vector, i.e., a list of numbers.

kanto = [73, 67, 43]
johto = [91, 88, 64]
hoenn = [87, 134, 58]
sinnoh = [102, 43, 37]
unova = [69, 96, 70]
```

The three numbers in each vector represent the temperature, rainfall, and humidity data, respectively. 

We can also represent the set of weights used in the formula as a vector.

```python
weights = [w1, w2, w3]
```

We can now write a function `crop_yield` to calcuate the yield of apples (or any other crop) given the climate data and the respective weights.

The three numbers in each vector represent the temperature, rainfall, and humidity data, respectively. 

We can also represent the set of weights used in the formula as a vector.

```python
weights = [w1, w2, w3]
```

We can now write a function `crop_yield` to calcuate the yield of apples (or any other crop) given the climate data and the respective weights.

```python
def crop_yield(region, weights):
    result = 0
    for x, w in zip(region, weights):
        result += x * w
    return result
```

## Going from Python lists to Numpy arrays


The calculation performed by the `crop_yield` (element-wise multiplication of two vectors and taking a sum of the results) is also called the dot product. Learn more about dot product here: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/dot-cross-products/v/vector-dot-product-and-vector-length

The Numpy library provides a built-in function to compute the dot product of two vectors. However, we must first convert the lists into Numpy arrays.

Let's install the Numpy library using the `pip` package manager.

```jupyter
!pip install numpy --upgrade --quiet
```

Next, let's import the `numpy` module. It's common practice to import numpy with the alias `np`.

```python
import numpy as np
```

We can now use the `np.array` function to create Numpy arrays.

```python
kanto = np.array([73, 67, 43])
kanto
# Output: array([73, 67, 43])
```
```python
weights = np.array([w1, w2, w3])
weights
# Output: array([0.3, 0.2, 0.5])
```

Numpy arrays have the type `ndarray`.

```python
type(kanto)
# Output: numpy.ndarray
```

```python
type(weights)
# Output: numpy.ndarray
```

Just like lists, Numpy arrays support the indexing notation `[]`.

```python
weights[0]
# Output: 0.3
```

```python
kanto[2]
# Output: 43
```

## Operating on Numpy arrays


We can now compute the dot product of the two vectors using the `np.dot` function.

```python
np.dot(kanto, weights)
# Output: 56.8
```

We can achieve the same result with low-level operations supported by Numpy arrays: performing an element-wise multiplication and calculating the resulting numbers' sum.

```python
(kanto * weights).sum()
# Output: 56.8
```

The `*` operator performs an element-wise multiplication of two arrays if they have the same size.

```python
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
arr1 * arr2
# Output: array([ 4, 10, 18])
```

```python
arr2.sum()
# Output: 15
```

Benefits of using Numpy arrays

Numpy arrays offer the following benefits over Python lists for operating on numerical data:

Ease of use: You can write small, concise, and intuitive mathematical expressions like (kanto * weights).sum() rather than using loops & custom functions like crop_yield.
Performance: Numpy operations and functions are implemented internally in C++, which makes them much faster than using Python statements & loops that are interpreted at runtime
Here's a comparison of dot products performed using Python loops vs. Numpy arrays on two vectors with a million elements each.

# Python lists
arr1 = list(range(1000000))
arr2 = list(range(1000000, 2000000))

# Numpy arrays
arr1_np = np.array(arr1)
arr2_np = np.array(arr2)
%%time
result = 0
for x1, x2 in zip(arr1, arr2):
    result += x1*x2
result
CPU times: user 151 ms, sys: 1.35 ms, total: 153 ms
Wall time: 152 ms
833332333333500000
%%time
np.dot(arr1_np, arr2_np)
CPU times: user 1.96 ms, sys: 751 Âµs, total: 2.71 ms
Wall time: 1.6 ms
833332333333500000
As you can see, using np.dot is 100 times faster than using a for loop. This makes Numpy especially useful while working with really large datasets with tens of thousands or millions of data points.

Multi-dimensional Numpy arrays
We can now go one step further and represent the climate data for all the regions using a single 2-dimensional Numpy array.

climate_data = np.array([[73, 67, 43],
                         [91, 88, 64],
                         [87, 134, 58],
                         [102, 43, 37],
                         [69, 96, 70]])
climate_data
array([[ 73,  67,  43],
       [ 91,  88,  64],
       [ 87, 134,  58],
       [102,  43,  37],
       [ 69,  96,  70]])
If you've taken a linear algebra class in high school, you may recognize the above 2-d array as a matrix with five rows and three columns. Each row represents one region, and the columns represent temperature, rainfall, and humidity, respectively.

Numpy arrays can have any number of dimensions and different lengths along each dimension. We can inspect the length along each dimension using the .shape property of an array.


# 2D array (matrix)
climate_data.shape
(5, 3)
weights
array([0.3, 0.2, 0.5])
# 1D array (vector)
weights.shape
(3,)
# 3D array 
arr3 = np.array([
    [[11, 12, 13], 
     [13, 14, 15]], 
    [[15, 16, 17], 
     [17, 18, 19.5]]])
arr3.shape
(2, 2, 3)
All the elements in a numpy array have the same data type. You can check the data type of an array using the .dtype property.

weights.dtype
dtype('float64')
climate_data.dtype
dtype('int64')
If an array contains even a single floating point number, all the other elements are also converted to floats.

arr3.dtype
dtype('float64')
We can now compute the predicted yields of apples in all the regions, using a single matrix multiplication between climate_data (a 5x3 matrix) and weights (a vector of length 3). Here's what it looks like visually:


You can learn about matrices and matrix multiplication by watching the first 3-4 videos of this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyAuNHPsq-g&list=PLFD0EB975BA0CC1E0&index=1 .

We can use the np.matmul function or the @ operator to perform matrix multiplication.

np.matmul(climate_data, weights)
array([56.8, 76.9, 81.9, 57.7, 74.9])
climate_data @ weights
array([56.8, 76.9, 81.9, 57.7, 74.9])
